Note: This project was developed for Google Geospatial Augmented Reality Challenge for educational purposes, and is not officially endorsed by the University of Florida or Florida Museum of Natural History.

Inspired by Augmented Reality game like Pokemon Go, this is a geospatial game to discover native animals hiding in our environment. For this demo, 3D models of native animals from Central Florida region appear when entering geo-fenced areas such as Paynes Prairie National Park, Florida Museum of Natural History, UF Bat Conservatory, and various areas of University of Florida campus such as lakes and “The Swamp” Gators Football stadium. The game encourages exploration of the outdoors and serves as a guide while out on the nature trails.

Players can see GPS-located 3D AR experiences in nature such as alligators, bats, butterflies, buffalo, manatees, wild boars and horses in their native habitats. In this game demo, there are 16 different species of animals to discover out in the field. For those not in the game’s location, the https://floridamon.com website offers 3D model viewer to demo the Augmented Reality animals.

The game was created in Unity using AR Core extension for Google Geospatial Creator with Cesium for Google Map Tiles API and Niantic Lightship used for occlusion and segmentation. The animated 3D models were purchased from Unity Asset Store, and over 200 3D models were generated with Luma AI text-to-NERF.
