# **Geospatial Florida Wildlife**
### *Google Geospatial AR Challenge*

![Project Logo](https://github.com/jayrosen-design/geospatial-wildlife/blob/main/app%20images/geospatial-logo-300x300.png)

Geospatial Florida Wildlife is an immersive Augmented Reality (AR) experience created for the **Google Geospatial AR Challenge**. This project pioneers geospatial gaming by offering an interactive journey through the diverse ecosystems of Central Florida.

---

## **Project Overview**
Inspired by popular AR games like *Pokémon Go*, Geospatial Florida Wildlife invites players to explore and discover native animals in their natural habitats. Players interact with lifelike 3D models of animals, including alligators, bats, butterflies, buffalo, manatees, wild boars, and horses, at geo-fenced locations.

### **Key Features**
- **Explore Iconic Locations**: Discover virtual wildlife at locations such as:
  - Paynes Prairie National Park
  - Florida Museum of Natural History
  - UF Bat Conservatory
  - University of Florida campus
- **16 Native Species**: Encounter various species modeled in 3D, integrated with their natural surroundings.
- **Remote Access**: A 3D model viewer is available on the project’s website for users unable to visit the geo-fenced locations.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Game Engine**: Unity with AR Core extension for Google Geospatial Creator.
- **Mapping**: Cesium for Google Map Tiles API and Niantic Lightship for advanced occlusion and segmentation.
- **3D Modeling**: Models sourced from Unity Asset Store and enhanced with over 200 models generated using Luma AI’s text-to-NERF technology.
