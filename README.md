Project Overview
Inspired by popular AR games like Pokémon Go, Geospatial Florida Wildlife invites players to explore and discover native animals hidden in our environment. This demo features lifelike 3D models of animals such as alligators, bats, butterflies, buffalo, manatees, wild boars, and horses, all replicated in their natural habitats.

Key Features:
Explore Iconic Locations: Interact with virtual wildlife at geo-fenced areas, including Paynes Prairie National Park, the Florida Museum of Natural History, the UF Bat Conservatory, and around the University of Florida campus.
16 Different Species: Encounter a variety of species in their natural settings.
Remote Access: For users not in the vicinity, the website offers a 3D model viewer to demonstrate the AR capabilities.
Development
The game is developed in Unity, leveraging the AR Core extension for Google Geospatial Creator. Integration with Cesium for Google Map Tiles API and Niantic Lightship provides advanced features such as occlusion and segmentation. The animated 3D models are sourced from the Unity Asset Store, supplemented by over 200 models generated with Luma AI’s text-to-NERF technology.

Disclaimer
This project is developed for educational purposes within the scope of the Google Geospatial Augmented Reality Challenge and is not officially endorsed by the University of Florida or the Florida Museum of Natural History.

Future Development
The current demo is just the beginning. Future enhancements will include interactive features for a more engaging user experience, expansion to additional locations, and integration of a multiplayer system for community-driven exploration and discovery.
